title: Enable Azure Analysis Service backup to Azure Storage Account with Firewall turned on 
---

Since Azure Analysis Service is a PaaS Service, trying to enable Azure Analysis Service backup to a storage account in the same region, seems to require firewall exclusions from Azure Analysis Service IP addresses.

These IP addresses are not published in [Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags â€“ Public Cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56519)

Further testing shows, even add the entire region subnet to the storage account firewall exception, it still doesn't work.

After enabled Storage Account Logging, it's apparently the following IP was blocked access to the storage account: 100.64.0.0/10

This range appears to be within Azure internal network.

After adding this range to the Storage Account firewall exclusion, the backup can be enabled successfully.
